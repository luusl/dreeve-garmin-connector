"""Putting a file into Dreeve's watch folder.

Dreeve scans that folder on its own five-minute schedule and imports whatever it finds, then
deletes it. It has no idea we are still writing, so a file must never be visible under its final
name until it is complete: write to a hidden `.part` alongside it, then rename. The rename is
atomic because the temp file lives in the very same directory, and therefore on the same
filesystem.
