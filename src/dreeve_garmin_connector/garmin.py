"""The one place that talks to Garmin.

This is an unofficial API on top of a library that has already had to rewrite its authentication
more than once. Everything it can do is funnelled through the narrow protocol below, so when Garmin
changes something the damage is contained to this file — and so the sync cycle can be tested in
full without an account.

The library's exceptions are translated here too. They are not interchangeable: one of them means
back off for hours, another means stop and ask a human, a third means try again in an hour. Losing
that distinction is how an account gets blocked.
