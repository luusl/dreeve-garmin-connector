"""One sync cycle: window, list, diff, cap, download, deliver, record.

The interesting part is not the happy path, it is what each kind of failure does. Garmin's errors
mean very different things — back off for hours, stop and ask a human, try again next cycle, never
try again — and treating them alike is how an account gets blocked or an activity gets lost. Each
one is handled exactly once, here.

The other rule worth stating: a cycle never downloads more than `MAX_DOWNLOADS_PER_CYCLE`. A first
run against five years of history is hundreds of files, and asking for all of them at once is the
single most reliable way to get rate-limited.
